## Part 2: Tweet Classification 

Completed by Derrick Eckardt on October 26, 2018.  Please direct any questions to [derrick@iu.edu](mailto:derrick@iu.edu)

The assignment prompt can be found at [Assignment 2 Prompt](https://github.iu.edu/cs-b551-fa2018/derrick-a2/blob/master/a2.pdf).  This readme file provides the required elements and my discussion of the process and the findings.

## Getting Started

As directed in the assignment, to run this program type the following at the command line:

    ./geolocate.py [training_tweets_file] [test_tweets_file] [output_file]
    
To run the data in the folder, you would specifically run:

    ./gelocate.py tweets.train.clean.txt tweets.test1.clean.txt output.txt                    
It takes approximately four seconds to run on the Silo server.

For a more details on the required set-up, please see the [Assignment 2 Prompt](https://github.iu.edu/cs-b551-fa2018/derrick-a2/blob/master/a2.pdf)

## Filtering the Input - To Fit or Not to Fit

Probably the most important thing in this data set is to make sure to make sure the data that is the most useful

Data scientists can get themselves into trouble by creating a model that works particularly well for a given dataset, and does not necessarily work well for other similar datasets.  This is called overfitting.
In using the data 

## Opportunities for Improvement
